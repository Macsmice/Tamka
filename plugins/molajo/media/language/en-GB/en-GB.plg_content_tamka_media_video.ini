DESC_START_PLAY=A positive integer. This parameter causes the player to begin playing the video at the given number of seconds from the start of the video. Note that similar to the seekTo function, the player will look for the closest keyframe to the time you specify. This means sometimes the play head may seek to just before the requested time, usually no more than ~2 seconds.
AUTO PLAY=Auto Play
DESC_AUTO_PLAY=Sets whether or not the initial video will autoplay when the player loads.
DESC_DISABLE_KEYBOARD_CONTROLS=Setting to Yes will disable the player keyboard controls. Keyboard controls are as follows: Spacebar: Play / Pause; Arrow Left: Restart current video; Arrow Right: Jump ahead 10% in the current video;  Arrow Up: Volume up; Arrow Down: Volume Down.
DISABLE KEYBOARD CONTROLS=Disable Keyboard Controls
DESC_ENABLE_ENHANCED_GENIE_MENU=Setting to Yes enables the Enhanced Genie Menu. This behavior causes the genie menu (if present) to appear when the user's mouse enters the video display area, as opposed to only appearing when the menu button is pressed.
DESC_LOOP=In the case of a single video player, a setting of Yes will cause the player to play the initial video again and again. In the case of a playlist player (or custom player), the player will play the entire playlist and then start again at the first video.
DESC_RELATED_VIDEO=Sets whether the player should load related videos once playback of the initial video starts. Related videos are displayed in the genie menu when the menu button is pressed.
